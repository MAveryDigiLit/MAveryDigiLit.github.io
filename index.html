    Hello! My name’s Matt Avery and I’ve got two major hobbies: sculpting with cardboard and playing the trumpet.
    I’ve used cardboard to sculpt a horse and buggy, cow head, camel in camo, and many more unexpected objects.
    I started playing trumpet in 4th grade and have since performed around the world.
    I hope to one day incorporate these two hobbies into my career.</p>
